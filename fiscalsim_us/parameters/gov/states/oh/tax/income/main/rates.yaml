      # The first $25,000 income are not taxed; Ohio has a tax cliff.
      # This is the rate implied by the starting tax amount $346.16
      # divided by $25,000.
      # Separately, we add a variable for being tax exempt, set if income
      # is below $25,000.
      # this same process is done for the year 2023 at $26,050
